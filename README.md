# multirotor-related-tasks
This repository features a collection of multi-rotor related tasks: path planning on Ardupilot Mission Planner, YOLOv7 training for alphanumeric detection and a python script that outlines further processing,  and a rough scheme for how the hardware should be connected
RoboFlow was used for custom trained dataset with classes for alphanumerics which was then fed them into YOLOv7 model and accuracies were reported
